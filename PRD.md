**My advice:**  
Instead of boiling the ocean ("all Jira features!"), let’s scope your PRD for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that hits the essentials:  
- Issue/ticket management  
- Agile boards (Kanban/Scrum-lite)  
- Comments & attachments  
- User roles/permissions  
- Simple workflow states  
We can call out “future/advanced features” (complex integrations, workflow automations, reporting, etc.) as non-goals or roadmap items.

**Here’s an outline you can react to (add/modify as needed):**

---

**1. TL;DR**  
Short intro: “Build a modern, developer-focused ticket tracking and agile board system for software teams, as a lightweight, open alternative to Jira Cloud—using Next.js and FastAPI.”

**2. Goals**  
- Business:  
    - Ship a working ticket/board MVP in X weeks  
    - Support teams up to Y users  
    - Allow self-hosting as well as cloud
- User:  
    - Easy, intuitive creation and management of tickets  
    - Visual kanban boards (drag & drop)  
    - Robust search/filtering  
    - Real-time collaboration

**3. Non-Goals**  
- Deep plugin marketplace  
- Enterprise-scale RBAC  
- Third-party integrations (for MVP)

**4. User Stories**  
(Personas: Developer, Team Lead, Admin)  
- As a Developer, I want to create and update tickets so I can track my work.  
- As a Team Lead, I want to manage sprints and move tickets across board columns.  
- As an Admin, I want to add/remove users and set project-level permissions.

**5. Functional Requirements**  
- Ticket CRUD, with custom fields  
- Kanban board view (drag & drop)  
- Basic user authentication & roles  
- Commenting system  
- Attachments (file uploads)  
- Real-time updates  

**6. User Experience**  
- Onboarding: first-time setup, create project, invite users  
- Core flow: create/view/edit/move tickets, comment, attach files  
- Error/empty states: Ticket not found, no tickets yet, permission denied  

**7. Success Metrics**  
- # projects created  
- DAU/MAU (active users)  
- Tickets resolved per week  
- User satisfaction feedback

**8. Technical Considerations**  
- Next.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend)  
- REST API design  
- WebSocket (real-time) for boards/comments  
- Postgres for data  
- File storage (basic, local or S3)  
- Privacy: user data isolation

**9. Milestones**  
- Week 1–2: Auth, Projects, Ticket CRUD  
- Week 3–4: Boards, Comments, Attachments  
- Week 5: UX polish, real-time updates
